# README

## This repo contains deployment tooling

The purpose of this repo is to provide deployment tooling to quickly setup various projects from around the web

Most are pointed at deploying on Openstack, mainly because that is what I have to work with

## Why don't these follow the same standards as everyone else?

This is simple, I don't like the standards. They are too hard for us normal people to understand

The aim is not to try to support everything and be flexible. 

Eng4Beer is prescriptive on how things should be done, and if you want something supported.. Hey we accept pull requests. 

## Check out the docs

Eng4Beer will have documents for all published projects. Check out the site for more details
